## Prerequisites

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

The code is run and tested with Python 3.7.6 on macOS 10.14.6.

### Environment

Clone the repo to your local machine.

Create a virtual environment for Python 3 with:

    pip3 install virtualenv
    virtualenv -p python3 env

Activate the virtual environment with:

    source env/bin/activate

Install the required Python packages with:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

If you incur any error, deactivate the virtualenv (type `deactivate`), start it again, and repeat the previous step.
